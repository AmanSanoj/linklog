      <h3>3. Service Description</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          LinkLog provides a fast, powerful web service for URL shortening and
          web analytics. The Service includes:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <strong>URL Shortener:</strong>
              A function that creates a short form URL from a longer existing
              URL. LinkLog provides tracking capabilities for the shortened
              URLs, including real-time clicks, IP addresses, and referrer
              information for statistical analysis accessible to the link
              creator.
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The content accessible via shortened URLs is not hosted by
                  LinkLog. We merely provide a redirection service.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Certain content or types of URLs may be blocked or may not
                  redirect through our Service, at our sole discretion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  While we endeavor to check shortened links for prohibited
                  content (e.g., phishing, adult content, malware), we do not
                  guarantee that all prohibited content will be blocked or
                  identified. You remain solely responsible for the content of
                  the URLs you shorten.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>IP-Lookup / Web Analytics:</strong>
              Allows for the collection and display of Visitor Data (including
              IP addresses, user-agent strings, timestamps, and referrers)
              associated with clicks on shortened URLs. This information is
              obtained from standard HTTP request headers.
              <ol>
                <li>
                  We are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of
                  publicly available information associated with IP addresses
                  (e.g., geographical location, ISP details) that may be
                  presented as part of the analytics.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          The Service is provided for lawful and legitimate purposes, primarily
          to assist users in managing and analyzing traffic to their links.

          required.
        </li>

          credentials (e.g., generated link IDs, access keys) and are fully
          responsible for all activities that occur in connection with your use
          of the Service.
        </li>

      <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Policy</h2>

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          This Privacy Policy describes how LinkLog collects, uses, and
          discloses information, including Personal Data, when you use our
          Service. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your
          data in a transparent manner.
        </li>
        <li>
          LinkLog is a URL shortening and web analytics service. Please note
          that while we provide tools for users to collect Visitor Data (like IP
          addresses) from those who click on their shortened links, **the user
          who creates the short link is the primary controller of this data for
          their specific links**, and is responsible for complying with all
          applicable data protection laws. LinkLog acts as a processor of this
          data on behalf of its users, or in certain cases, as a joint
          controller.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Information Collected from Link Visitors:</strong>
          When an individual clicks on a shortened URL generated using LinkLog,
          we automatically collect the following Visitor Data:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <strong>IP Address:</strong>
              The Internet Protocol address of the visitor's device.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Timestamp:</strong>
              The date and time of the click.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>User-Agent String:</strong>
              Information about the visitor's browser, operating system, and
              device.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Referrer URL:</strong>
              The URL of the webpage that referred the visitor to the shortened
              link (if available).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Shortened URL ID:</strong>
              The unique identifier of the LinkLog shortened URL that was
              clicked.
            </li>
          </ol>
          This Visitor Data is collected to provide the web analytics
          functionality to the user who created the shortened link.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Information Collected from Link Creators (Users of the Service):
          </strong>
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <strong>No Personal Information during Link Creation:</strong>
              LinkLog does not collect any Personal Data (such as names, email
              addresses, or account details) from you during the process of
              creating a shortened link, unless you explicitly provide it for a
              specific feature (e.g., if we introduce an optional account
              system).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Aggregated Usage Data:</strong>
              We may collect non-identifying aggregated data about the overall
              usage of the Service (e.g., total number of links created, total
              clicks) to improve the Service.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Persistent Tracking Technologies:</strong>
          LinkLog does not currently employ cookies, tracking pixels, or other
          persistent tracking technologies on its main service for the purpose
          of identifying individual users or visitors across different websites
          or over time. All collected Visitor Data is directly related to a
          specific click on a shortened URL.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>3. Use of Collected Information</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Visitor Data collected is solely used to provide the functionality
          of the Service, specifically:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              To generate and present analytics and reporting features (e.g.,
              click counts, geographic distribution, device types) to the
              authorized user who created the shortened link.
            </li>
            <li>
              To detect and prevent fraudulent, abusive, or malicious activity
              related to the Service (e.g., spam, DDoS attacks).
            </li>
            <li>
              For internal operational purposes, such as service monitoring,
              maintenance, and debugging.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Visitor Data will not be used for unrelated purposes without explicit
          consent from the relevant data subject or as required by law.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          LinkLog does not sell, rent, or lease your Personal Data or Visitor
          Data to third parties for their independent marketing or commercial
          purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may share Visitor Data and other information in the following
          limited circumstances:
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <strong>With the Link Creator:</strong>
              Visitor Data associated with a specific shortened URL is made
              available to the user who created that URL, as part of the core
              functionality of the Service.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Service Providers:</strong>
              We use third-party service providers (e.g., hosting providers like
              CloudFlare) to facilitate our Service. These providers may have
              access to the data we store but are contractually obligated to use
              it solely for the purpose of providing services to us and in
              compliance with our instructions. Users are encouraged to review
              CloudFlare own privacy policy for details about data handling
              practices on their platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong>
              We may disclose information if required to do so by law, court
              order, subpoena, or governmental request, or if we believe in good
              faith that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal
              obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of
              LinkLog, (iii) protect the personal safety of users of the Service
              or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Business Transfers:</strong>
              In the event that LinkLog is involved in a merger, acquisition, or
              sale of assets, your information may be transferred as part of
              that transaction.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          We implement commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and
          physical safeguards designed to protect your data against unauthorized
          access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures
          include, but are not limited to, access controls, secure coding
          practices, and regular security reviews.
        </li>
        <li>
          Notwithstanding these measures, no security system is impenetrable.
          Transmission of data via the internet and electronic storage carries
          inherent risks. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot
          guarantee its absolute security.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Important Note on Encryption:</strong>
          For performance considerations, direct end-to-end encryption of all
          raw stored Visitor Data (e.g., IP addresses in our logs) is not
          currently employed within LinkLog's immediate storage. This means
          that, while access to our systems is strictly controlled and data is
          processed securely, the confidentiality of this specific data relies
          primarily on our robust internal access controls and the security
          measures implemented by our hosting provider (CloudFlare). Users
          should be aware of this aspect when deciding to use the service and
          when considering the implications of collecting IP addresses from
          their link visitors.
        </li>
        <li>
          All information collected by LinkLog is accessible to the website
          owner for purposes of service operation, maintenance, and fulfilling
          user requests (e.g., data deletion).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>6. Data Retention</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          We retain Visitor Data and other collected information for as long as
          necessary to provide the Service, fulfill the purposes outlined in
          this Privacy Policy, and comply with our legal obligations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Typically, Visitor Data linked to a specific shortened URL will be
          retained for the operational lifetime of that URL, or until a deletion
          request is processed, unless a longer retention period is required or
          permitted by law.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>7. Your Data Rights (for Link Visitors)</h3>
      <p>
        If you are a visitor whose data has been collected via a LinkLog
        shortened URL, you have certain rights regarding your Personal Data,
        subject to applicable law:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Right of Access:</strong>
          You have the right to request a copy of the Personal Data LinkLog
          holds about you.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Right to Erasure ("Delete Me"):</strong>
          You have the right to request the deletion of your Personal Data from
          our records.
          <ol type="a">
            <li>
              <strong>To Request Deletion:</strong>
              Please send an email containing your current IP address and the
              *exact full shortened URL* (e.g., `/1ns815`) from which you wish
              your data removed to
              <a href="mailto:false-stilt-trout@duck.com">
                false-stilt-trout@duck.com
              </a>
              .
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Limitations:</strong>
              Please be advised that if your IP address has changed since your
              last access (e.g., due to dynamic IP assignment or using a
              different network), it may not be feasible to accurately locate
              and delete all of your records. Additionally, deletion requests
              cannot be processed without the corresponding exact short link
              URL.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Notification to Link Owner:</strong>
              Note that the owner of the shortened link will be notified that a
              deletion request has been made concerning data associated with
              their link.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong>
          You may request that we limit the use of your data under certain
          circumstances, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Right to Object:</strong>
          You may object to our processing of your data based on legitimate
          interests or for direct marketing purposes (though LinkLog does not
          engage in direct marketing using Visitor Data).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How to Exercise Your Rights:</strong>

          The Service is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do
          not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 13. If we
          become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Data from a
          child under 13, we will delete such information from our records. If
          you believe we might have any information from or about a child under
          13, please contact us.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>9. International Data Transfers</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Our Service operates globally, and your data may be stored and
          processed in any country where we have facilities or where we engage
          service providers. By using the Service, you understand that your
          information may be transferred to countries outside of your country of
          residence, which may have different data protection laws than your
          country.
        </li>
      </ol>
